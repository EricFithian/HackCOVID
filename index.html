        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <h2>Why is the HackCOVID website so... well... basic?</h2>
        <p>Our team's highest priority is responding immediately and efficiently to the rapidly deteriorating global situation. Although we would usually support the pursuit of the highest quality, there simply isn't enough time to do so when many organizations on the frontlines of this medical war desperately need all the help they can get as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>This weekend, we encourage you to focus on creating MVPs that are good enough to support them right away.</p>
        <h2>Okay, where will HackCOVID happen?</h2>
        <p>Wherever you are. HackCOVID is an international virtual hackathon. So far, we have already seen registrations from Duke University, Taipei, London, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco!</p>
        <h2>If we're all around the world, what time do we start?</h2>
        <p>開工時間：星期五傍晚 8 點 - - UTC: FRI 1200 - - US Start: FRI 8 am EDT</p>
        <p>遞交時間：星期一早晨 9 點 - - UTC: MON 0100 - - US Submit: SUN 9 pm EDT</p>
        <p>We will release hackathon prompts to all participants on Friday (20 March) at 1200 UTC. Bubmissions are due on Monday morning (23 March) at 0100 UTC.</p>
        <p>That gives you 60 hours to work on your projects, so we highly encourage you to join workshops from other countries, communicate with fellow techies around the world, and, most importantly, get enough sleep!</p>
        <h2>Why are you using UTC?</h2>
        <p>UTC (or Universal Time Coordinated) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.</p>
        <h2>Who can participate?</h22>
        <p>Everyone!</p>
        <h2>How many people can we have on each team?</h2>
        <p>Any number you want up to five. You can even work on multiple teams and submit as many projects as you want!</p>
        <h2>What can we make?</h2>
        <p>You can build your own ideas, and we will provide prompts from organizations that are already on the frontlines of this war against coronavirus. Feel free to build and submit as many projects as you want!</p>
