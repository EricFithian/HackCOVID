        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <h2>What's going on here?</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to combine technology, medicine, entrepreneurship, and education to defeat coronavirus. Our highest priority for the rest of March is to respond immediately and efficiently to the rapidly deteriorating global situation.</p>
        <p>Many organizations on the frontlines of this medical war desperately need all the help they can get as soon as possible, so we are focused on delivering GOOD ENOUGH, RIGHT NOW.</p>
        <p>Similarly, for 3.2.1 HackCOVID this weekend, we encourage you to focus on solving problems by creating MVPs that are GOOD ENOUGH, RIGHT NOW.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Okay, I'm in! Where will HackCOVID happen?</h2>
        <p>Everywhere. HackCOVID is the first anti-coronavirus international virtual hackathon. So far, we have already seen registrations from Taipei, London, New York City, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
        <p><a href = "https://scottyshaw.typeform.com/to/rEKgZX" target = "_blank">Everyone who signs up!</a></p>
        <p>We will pass on urgent requests for anti-coronavirus solutions, updates about events, and other relevant information.</p>

        <p>遞交時間：星期一早晨 9 點 - - UTC: MON 0100 - - US Submit: SUN 9 pm EDT</p> -->
        <p>You will have 60 hours between the release of this weekend's prompts and the submission deadline to work on your projects, so we highly encourage you to join workshops from other countries, communicate with fellow techies around the world, build MVPs to defeat coronavirus, and, most importantly, get enough sleep to stay healthy!</p>
        <p>REMEMBER: Staying healthy is the best way for us to defeat coronavirus!</p>
        <p>If your product is GOOD ENOUGH to help out RIGHT NOW, then please submit it and get enough sleep.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>How many people can we have on each team?</h2>
        <p>Each team can have up to five, but, you can work on multiple teams and submit as many projects as you want!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What should we make?</h2>
        <p>You can build your own ideas, and we will provide prompts from organizations that are already on the frontlines of this war against coronavirus. Feel free to build and submit as many projects as you want!</p>
